It's an awesome platform for any kind of online courses, I did Farha apu's entrepreneurs course I learn lots of tips & tricks from apu she is wonderful lady with lots of knowledge, I totally fall in love with her teaching style though the course is ended but I am going to miss her .I recommend every one if you are planning to start your business you can choose Ostad without any hesitation cause Farha apu is excellent instructor.

Definitely Highly recommended. The main instructor was Sashoto Seeam sir, who taught us, how a designer thinks.
There should have some reasons for every decision, there have more than 16 million different colors, why does a designer choose the specific one? What is the story behind it? And I learned lots of things from him. ( UX process, design system, app design, user research, and more!)
If you are a beginner or have some knowledge of UI or UX you can join this type of cour… See more

This is my first time taking a class with OSTAD, so the experience was unique. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I am pleased with this format. The instructor was very knowledgeable, worked at a good pace, and most importantly, was very good at communicating with all the attendees and ensuring questions were answered. I would definitely recommend OSTAD to others and I hope to have the opportunity to attend more training classes with OSTAD

Do you know that planning and strategy give you the best outcome where the subject doesn't matter? Let's plan.
I have completed my bachelor's degree in Bangla literature but my passion for becoming a data analyst. That's the time I find out Ostad is doing better to create value for the Data Science course. As a beginner Ostad curriculum helps me to understand key points of data science. After completing the course I got mentorship from Data science mentor Nurul Akter Towhid … See more

জাস্ট নামের উপর দিয়ে চলছে। ফেমাস ইনস্ট্রাকদের ব্লেন্ড করে কোর্স তৈরি করে হচ্ছে সো দ্যাট মানুষজনের আগ্রহ বাড়ে। ক্লাসগুলোতে কিছু না দেখিয়ে, না করিয়ে, এসাইনমেন্ট দিয়ে দেয়ার নামই কোর্স না। আমি মানি সবকিছু আপনারা ধরে ধরে শেখাবেন না। কিন্তু শুধু স্বরবর্ণ পড়িয়ে এরপর একটা এসাইনমেন্ট দিয়ে দিবেন যেখানে ব্যঞ্জনবর্ণও লাগবে, শব্দও তৈরি করা জানতে হবে, বাক্য তৈরি করা জেনে একেবারে পুরো রচণা লিখতে হবে! তাহলে কিভাবে হলো ভাই!!!

Do you know that planning and strategy give you the best outcome where the subject doesn't matter? Let's plan.
I have completed my bachelor's degree in Bangla literature but my passion for becoming a data analyst. That's the time I find out Ostad is doing better to create value for the Data Science course. As a beginner Ostad curriculum helps me to understand key points of data science. After completing the course I got mentorship from Data science mentor Nurul Akter Towhid … See more
